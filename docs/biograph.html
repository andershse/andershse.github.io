        <h1>Biography of Anders Hansson</h1>

<h3>
Anders Hansson was born in Trelleborg, Sweden, in 1964.
He received the Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering
in 1989, the Degree of Licentiate of Engineering in Automatic Control in
1991, and the PhD in Automatic Control
in 1995, all from Lund University, Lund, Sweden. In 1989, 
1992, and 1995 he spent three months at Landis & Gyr AG, 
Switzerland. During the academic year 1992-1993 he spent six months at 
Imperial College in London, UK. From 1989 until 1995 he was a 
Teaching Assistant at
the Department of Automatic Control, Lund Institute of Technology. From 1995
until 1997 he was a postdoctoral student, and from 1997 until 1998 a
research associate
at the Information Systems Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering,
Stanford University. In 1998 he was appointed assistant professor and
in 2000 associate professor (docent) at 
S3-Automatic Control, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm,
Sweden. In 2001 he was appointed associate professor at the Division of
Automatic Control, Linköping University. From 2006 he is full
professor at the same department. He was a visiting professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA during 2011-2012. 
Anders Hansson is a senior member of the 
IEEE. During 2006-2007 he was an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on 
Automatic Control. He was a member of the EUCA Council 2009-2015 and currently from 2022 again. 
He is a member of the 
Technical Committee on Robust and Complex Systems of the 
IEEE Control Systems Society and of the IFAC Technical Committee on Robust Control from 2009. His 
research interests are within the fields of optimal control,
stochastic control, linear systems,
signal processing, fuzzy logic, applications of control,
image processing, and telecommunications.
He got the SAAB-Scania Research Award in 1992.
